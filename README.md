# Bank of Sheep

This is a Minecraft datapack to provide secure in-game storage via vanilla.

## What is in the Box?

Currently we only create a dimension.  Over time there will be more functions and elements related to supporting
automated usage fo the vaults.

### `bos:vaults` dimension

This is a flat world consisting of the following layers:
* 4 blocks of water
* 4 blocks of sand
* 4 blocks of bedrock 

## Installation

Install this into the world's `datapack` directory as `bos`.  The game must be stopped and reloaded in order to function
properly.
